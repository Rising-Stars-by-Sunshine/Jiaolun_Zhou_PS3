# Definition of XAI
XAI stands for "Explainable Artificial Intelligence." It refers to the practice of developing artificial intelligence (AI) systems and machine learning models in such a way that their outputs and decision-making processes can be easily understood and explained by humans. The goal of XAI is to make AI more transparent and interpretable, addressing the "black box" problem where AI models make complex decisions that are difficult to comprehend.

In the context of XAI, "explainability" means providing insights into why an AI system arrived at a particular decision or prediction. This can be crucial in applications where transparency and accountability are important, such as healthcare, finance, autonomous vehicles, and legal systems. By making AI systems more explainable, developers and users can gain a better understanding of their behavior and potential biases, ultimately enhancing trust and enabling better decision-making.

Various techniques and approaches are used in XAI, including the development of interpretable models, the generation of model-agnostic explanations, and the visualization of decision processes. The specific methods employed may vary depending on the AI application and the level of interpretability required.
